## 📂 Contents

### ✅ Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort** – Simple comparison-based sorting.  
2. **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one element at a time.  
3. **Selection Sort** – Selects the smallest/largest element and places it in the correct position.  
4. **Merge Sort** – Divide & Conquer algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.  
5. **Quick Sort** – Efficient divide & conquer sorting using partitioning.

### ✅ Mini Project
- **Student Management System (Basic Version)**  
  - Add Student (ID, Name, Age)  
  - View All Students  
  - Remove Student by ID  
  - Exit option  

This project uses **Java Collections, OOP concepts, and user input handling**.
